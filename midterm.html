	<h3><a name="History">History</a></h3>

			<p>
				Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts was founded as the <b>Freshman Year Program</b> at The New School in 1972 as a pre-college program for high school graduates. Three years later, in 1975, the program was expanded to a full undergraduate program and renamed <b>The Seminar College</b>. In 1985, following a generous donation by a well-known philanthropist and educational visionary Eugene Lang and his wife Theresa, the school was renamed Eugene Lang College. The college currently has an enrollment of over 1,345 students.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2005, the phrase "The New School" was inserted into the name of each division of The New School as part of a unification strategy initiated by the University's President Bob Kerrey; thus, Eugene Lang College was renamed <b>Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts</b>. In 2015, The New School rebranded again by renaming the schools to better clarify the relationship between the university and its schools. Eugene Lang College's formal title is <b>The New School's Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts</b>.
